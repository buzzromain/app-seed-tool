/*
 * Regression test for the missing upper bound on `shards_count` in
 * sskr_combine_shards().
 *
 * sskr_combine_shards() deserializes into a fixed-size stack array:
 *
 *     sskr_shard_t shards[SSS_MAX_SHARE_COUNT * SSKR_MAX_GROUP_COUNT];
 *
 * SSKR_MAX_GROUP_COUNT is 1, and SSS_MAX_SHARE_COUNT is 10 on TARGET_NANOS
 * (16 elsewhere). The test derives its shard counts from those macros rather
 * than hardcoding a capacity, so it is valid for either configuration.
 * This suite compiles with -DTARGET_NANOS (see CMakeLists.txt), so the array
 * holds 10 entries here.
 *
 * Only `shards_count == 0` used to be rejected. A caller passing a larger
 * count wrote past the end of `shards` before any validation ran.
 *
 * This is reachable without an attacker and without a malformed shard: the
 * Nano S recovery UI derives its shard count from the member-threshold nibble
 * of the entered shard ((byte & 0x0F) + 1, so 1..16), while the Stax/Flex
 * generation UI accepts a threshold of up to 16. Verifying a legitimate
 * 12-of-16 backup on a Nano S therefore called this function with
 * shards_count = 12 against a 10-entry array.
